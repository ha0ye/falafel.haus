### Teaching Philosophy

I strive to make my teaching accessible and actionable, through setting expectations up front, and developing content and exercises that center learning.

My formal training comes from:

* "Teaching + Learning at the College Level", a course on evidence-based teaching practices taught by UCSD's Teaching + Learning Commons. (The course is now called ["Introduction to College Teaching"](https://commons.ucsd.edu/educators/future-faculty-programs/introduction-to-college-teaching.html).)
* The Carpentries [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and [Trainer Training](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/).  
  I have been a Carpentries Instructor since 2018, and an Instructor Trainer since 2021.

### UF Instruction

I am a co-instructor at UF for GMS 5909 "Finding Biomedical Research Information and Communicating Science" (Fall 2020; *planned Fall 2022*)

I also do course-integrated instruction in a variety of reproduciblity-themed topics, such as version control, FAIR data, rigor and reproducibility, etc.

I teach standalone workshops using my own OER materials. For a listing of the workshops, please see the [lesson modules](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/reproducibility/lessons) page of my libguide, and the [HSCL Workshops calendar](https://libcal.uflib.ufl.edu/calendar/HSCLWorkshops) for all upcoming workshops taught at HSCL.

### Experience and Awards

I co-ran the SIO R Users Group for many years, receiving the [E.W. Fager Award in 2014](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/trio-scripps-students-receive-fager-awards).

I served as a teaching assistant multiple times for different courses while a graduate student in the UCSD Psychology Department; as well as CS 1, the introductory computer science course while an undergraduate student at Caltech.

For many years, I was also an instructor for the San Diego Math Circle and a coach of the San Diego ARML Teams.

### Computational Training

I have taught or assisted with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshops at the University of Minnesota, the University of Florida, and the University of California San Diego.

In addition to teaching, I was a board member for the [UF Carpentries Club](https://uf-carpentries.org/) from 2017-2019, which organizes computational workshops and related events at the University of Florida. I have also led the organization of two Research Bazaar events at UF that include: talks, panel discussions, tutorials, and more: [ResBaz2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbazFor2018/gainesville/) [ResBaz2019](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/gainesville/).

As part of the [Open Data Science at SIO](https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/), I also led the following informal seminars:

* [Introduction to Data Visualization and Data Wrangling in R](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017)
* [Reproducible Research in R for Ocean Biosciences: Open-science Training Seminar](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/RRROBOTS)
