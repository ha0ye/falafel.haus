description: As the Reproducibility Librarian at the University of Florida, I provide training and consultations in open research, reproducible practices, and computational workflows. I empower individuals and teams to work more openly as a means to both improve the work, as well as disrupt inequitable power structures. In addition to teaching project and computational skills, I co-lead [Alligator Ally Skills](https://alligatorallyskills.weebly.com/) and teach workshops on how to use everyday actions to improve inclusion and accessibility. I also stream [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday) every other week - LINK.
